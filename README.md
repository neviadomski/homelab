# Kubernetes from scratch

**Hey, there!**

**I’m Sergei, and I’m passionate about Machine Learning, Software Engineering, HomeLabing and nerd staff in general.**

This Repository contains my personal code for automated deployment of Kubernetes from scratch. Here you'll find configs, customizations, and whatever else you need.

> :warning: Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this won’t always be the case.

## Prerequisites

* One or more bare-metal server with installed [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview). All in one cluster.
* Prepared Debian based template on one of nodes. (I use [Ubuntu server 23.10 cloud image](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/mantic/current/) with [cloud-init](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Cloud-Init_Support))
